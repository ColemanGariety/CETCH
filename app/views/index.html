<h3>What is this?</h3>

<p>CETCH is a computer science competition with participants from all over the world. Each week we solve a computer science puzzle of varying difficulty and upload our programs here. On Friday at midnight, all the entries are run in a sandbox and the execution times are clocked. <b>The fastest solution wins.</b> A new competition begins immediately after the previous one has ended.</p>

<h3>Rules:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>You may only use languages as specified by the competition</li>
  <li>You may only use those language's standard libraries</li>
  <li>Your entry program may not contain the solution itself</li>
</ol>
