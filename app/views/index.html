<h3>What is this?</h3>

<p>CETCH is a computer program benchmarking competition. Each week we present a computationally soluble problem of varying complexity. It's up to you to solve it in one of the allowed languages. On Friday at midnight, all the entries are run in a sandbox and the execution times are clocked. The program with the fastest execution time wins.</p>
